Overview of the Project : 

Project : Simple Calculator 

Objective : Develop a command-line based calculator in Java that performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Key points : 
The calculator should:
1. Accept user input for two numbers and the desired operation.
2. Display the result of the operation.
3. Handle invalid inputs gracefully by prompting the user to enter valid numbers and operations.
4. Allow the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit the program.

Technologies used : 

1. Java Programming Language: The core language for writing the calculator application.

2. Java Development Kit (JDK): The environment needed to compile and run Java applications.

3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Optional tools like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans for coding, debugging, and managing the project.

4. Standard Input/Output (I/O): Using Scanner for user input and System.out for output to the console.

5. Basic Control Structures: Utilizing conditionals (if, switch) and loops (while, for) for program flow control.

6. Exception Handling: Managing errors using try-catch blocks, especially for invalid number formats or division by zero.

Conclusion : 

This project will help you practice fundamental Java concepts, such as input handling, conditionals, loops, and basic arithmetic operations.
